# 🏠 Home Credit Default Risk - Kaggle Challenge

This project is a solution to the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to predict the probability that an applicant will default on a loan based on a variety of financial, demographic, and behavioral features.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Home Credit seeks to expand credit opportunities to unbanked individuals. Accurate credit scoring helps them responsibly provide loans while managing risk. This project builds a predictive model that ranks applicants based on their default likelihood.

## 📂 Dataset Used

The dataset contains both a main application file and multiple auxiliary tables:

- `application_train.csv` / `application_test.csv`
- `bureau.csv` / `bureau_balance.csv`
- `previous_application.csv`
- `POS_CASH_balance.csv`
- `installments_payments.csv`
- `credit_card_balance.csv`

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Merged and aggregated auxiliary tables into the main training set.
- Dropped columns with more than **60% missing values**.
- Imputed remaining missing values:
  - **Numerical** → median
  - **Categorical** → mode
- Applied **label encoding** to binary features and **one-hot encoding** to low-cardinality categorical features.
- Engineered ratio features:
  - `CREDIT_INCOME_RATIO = AMT_CREDIT / AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`
  - `ANNUITY_INCOME_RATIO = AMT_ANNUITY / AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`
  - `ANNUITY_CREDIT_RATIO = AMT_ANNUITY / AMT_CREDIT`
  - `EMPLOYED_PERCENT = DAYS_EMPLOYED / DAYS_BIRTH`

Final dataset contained **168 features** after preprocessing.

## ⚙️ Modeling Approach

- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - LightGBM (final model)
- Feature selection using **Random Forest feature importance** (top 50 features)
- Hyperparameter tuning via **Optuna**
- **5-fold stratified cross-validation** with out-of-fold (OOF) AUC evaluation
- Final model trained using best parameters from Optuna.

## 📈 Results

| Model                    | Public AUC | Private AUC |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression     | ~0.703     | ~0.705      |
| LightGBM (all features) | ~0.765     | 0.76718     |
| LightGBM (top 50)       | 0.76426    | **0.76966** ✅ |
